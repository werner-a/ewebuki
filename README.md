=eWeBuKi=

is a PHP-based web-publishing system to manage websites online. Friends of good design are left with all liberties of HTML, editors get an easy way of changing the content of a web site without the hassle of special languages or tools.

==Description==

This is achieved by storing all content in a database; the formatting is done via templates which can be changed with any HTML editor.

In contrast to other Content Management Systems *eWeBuKi* divides a web site into ranges. These ranges are recursively processed with a so-called "Parser". If a range is not assigned to special template, the standard template will be used automatically. This assignment is controlled by a simple variable. Thus any functionality can actually be visualized within the kit. The content is stored in the database in several languages and category-dependently. It can be changed right there - in pure ASCII with special tags or in HTML - with any web browser.

_From this description, the assumtion is correct that *eWeBuKi* is not focusing the home user who wants to create a website with a few mouse clicks. The target group are developers and web designers who are looking for a system which is flexible to a considerable degree and nearly indefinitely expandable.
However, because all fundamental functions are actually made available by the kit, a static site without interaction can be set up in a few hours._

The requirements for *eWeBuKi* are Linux as operating system, an Apache webserver with mod_rewrite activated, MySQL (optional PostgreSQL) as database and PHP.
