====================================================================
Hi!
Welcome to the step-for-step install-tutorial von eWeBuKi!
====================================================================

This document is not written by the author of eWeBuKi, Werner 
Ammon for he - as every programmer - has no clue what difficulties 
arise when you don't have any idea what MySQL, PHP or similar are 
but nevertheless want to use eWeBuKi.

When a line starts with 
#
then this is an example of what you can/could/should enter at your 
server's command line. The path names are pure examples!


1) First of all:
================
SAVE ANY DOCUMENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE OF YOUR OLD WEBSERVER!

I did what Werner recommended:

#cd /var/www
#mv htdocs htdocs.sav
#tar xvzf /foo/bar/eWeBuKi.1.0.0.tar.gz
#mv eWeBuKi.1.1.0 htdocs
#chown wwwrun.nogroup htdocs

(the path /foo/bar OF COURSE is only an example, you should put the 
real location of the downloaded archive here) That way, you don't 
accidentally overwrite your index.html or something similar 
important.

2) Install phpMyAdmin
=====================
Then, download phpMyAdmin at

http://www.phpmyadmin.net/index.php?dl=1

Untar the archive in your /usr/local/share tree and create a 
symbolic link towards the directory.

#cd /usr/local/share
#tar xvjf /foo/bar/phpMyAdmin-2.4.1-php.tar.bz2
#cd /var/www/htdocs
#rm phpMyAdmin 
#ln -s /usr/local/share/phpMyAdmin-2.4.1 phpMyAdmin

The "rm" is only needed if Werner still included his own link into 
the distribution archive... :-) 

The actual path name of phpMyAdmin varies with the ongoing versions, 
so PLEASE don't just type what's written above but see for yourself.


3) Change Password in phpMyAdmin's config
=========================================
We do state that your MySQL is up and running and that you had any 
possibility to enter a "root"-password for MySQL. Please don't mix 
this up with the password of the "root"-User of your System! If you 
did NOT enter any root password, you can skip the next paragraph.

Change into the directory of phpMyAdmin and enter the MySQL-root-
password in the file config.inc.php

#cd /var/www/htdocs/phpMyAdmin
#joe config.inc.php

It's quite a bit down, the line is
$cfg'Servers'$i'password = '' ;

enter the password between the ''.

While you're at it, edit eWeBuKi's configuration as well:

#cd /var/www/htdocs/config
#joe site.cfg.php

in the lines

define ('DB_USER', 'changeme')change "changeme" to "root" and in
define ('DB_PASSWORD', 'changeme')  enter the correct password.


4) Create eWeBuKi database
============================
You should now be able to start phpMyAdmin via your favourite 
browser. At my site, it's 

http://192.168.240.3/phpMyAdmin

If anything goes wrong, try to restart MySQL, check the proper 
installation, check if Apache is up and running, if PHP is running 
smoothly, if mod_rewrite is activated in Apache's config.

You should see a two-framed screen with a 

MySQL
>Create new database

field in the right frame, left border.
Just enter

eWeBuKi

(this is case-sensitive, so don't try "ewebuki" or "EWEBUKI")
and klick onto the "Create" button. You will then be able to read

No tables found in database.

Click onto the "SQL" tab in the top row.

Click onto the "Browse" button in that window and select the file 

eWeBuKi.mysql.sql

in your htdocs-directory. (That of course is only possible if you can access 
that directory from the computer you run the browser on!)

Then click onto "Go".



5) Check
========
Now start up your browser and access your server.
You should see something like 

"Gratulation"

Ta-Daaa!


6) Securing the Site
====================
PLEASE!!!!!! Do us a favor and change / delete the admin user 
"changeme", otherwise your site will be the easy prey for hackers 
like us :-)


Step 1: Change the Editing User
===============================
To do that, reenter phpMyAdmin (http://yourhost/phpMyAdmin)
- Select "eWeBuKi" under the text "Home" in the left frame.
- Click onto the tiny icon left of "auth_user" (NOT the text itself!)
- You see the line with "eWeBuKi". 
- You now can edit this line or add a new user.
- NEVER, NEVER, NEVER delete the last user!


Step 2: Change the database user
================================
With step 1, you prevented other people from changing the contents 
of your new site.

Now, we have to secure your database itself.
To do that, reenter phpMyAdmin (http://yourhost/phpMyAdmin)
- Under "Home", select "mysql" (left frame)
- Click onto the tiny icon left of "user" (NOT "user" itself)
  You should now see the users you already have.
- Click onto "Insert new row" (auf Deutsch "Neue Zeile einfuegen")
- In the field "Host" enter "localhost", leave the function empty
- In "User" enter your desired user, leave the function empty
- In "Password" enter your password in cleartext, select "PASSWORD"
  as function.
- You can leave all checkboxes on "N".
- Click on "Go".
Half way done
- Click on the tiny icon left of "db"
- Click onto "Insert new row" (auf Deutsch "Neue Zeile einfuegen")
- In the field "Host" enter "localhost", leave the function empty
- In the field "Db" enter "eWeBuKi", leave the function empty
- In the field "User" enter the SAME user as before.
- Check "Insert", "Update", "Select" and "Delete" to "Y"es

- restart MySQL.

Now edit eWeBuKi's configuration

#cd /var/www/htdocs/config
#joe site.cfg.php

in the lines
define ('DB_USER', 'root')      change "root" to the newly created user.
define ('DB_PASSWORD', 'xxx')   enter the correct password.

DONE!
